    "# Unit test writing using a multi-step prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex tasks, such as writing unit tests, can benefit from multi-step prompts. In contrast to a single prompt, a multi-step prompt generates text from GPT and then feeds that output text back into subsequent prompts. This can help in cases where you want GPT to reason things out before answering, or brainstorm a plan before executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a 3-step prompt to write unit tests in Python using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explain**: Given a Python function, we ask GPT to explain what the function is doing and why.\n",
    "2. **Plan**: We ask GPT to plan a set of unit tests for the function.\n",
    "    - If the plan is too short, we ask GPT to elaborate with more ideas for unit tests.\n",
    "3. **Execute**: Finally, we instruct GPT to write unit tests that cover the planned cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code example illustrates a few embellishments on the chained, multi-step prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditional branching (e.g., asking for elaboration only if the first plan is too short)\n",
    "- The choice of different models for different steps\n",
    "- A check that re-runs the function if the output is unsatisfactory (e.g., if the output code cannot be parsed by Python's `ast` module)\n",
    "- Streaming output so that you can start reading the output before it's fully generated (handy for long, multi-step outputs)"

      "- The `pig_latin` function takes in a string `text` as an argument.\n",
      "- Inside the `pig_latin` function, there is another nested function called `translate` which takes in a string `word` as an argument.\n",
      "- The `translate` function initializes a string variable `vowels` with the value 'aeiou', representing the vowels in the English alphabet.\n",
      "- The `translate` function checks if the first letter of the `word` is in the `vowels` string.\n",
      "  - If the first letter is a vowel, it appends the string 'way' to the `word` and returns it.\n",
      "  - If the first letter is a consonant, it initializes an empty string variable `consonants`.\n",
      "  - It then iterates through each letter in the `word`.\n",
      "    - If the letter is not in the `vowels` string, it appends the letter to the `consonants` string.\n",
      "    - If the letter is in the `vowels` string, it breaks out of the loop.\n",
      "  - Finally, it returns the `word` without the leading consonants, followed by the `consonants` string, and then the string 'ay'.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The `pig_latin` function continues by converting the `text` to lowercase using the `lower()` method and splitting it into a list of words using the `split()` method. This list is stored in the variable `words`.\n",
      "- It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list called `translated_words` by applying the `translate` function to each word in the `words` list.\n",
      "- Finally, the `pig_latin` function joins the `translated_words` list into a single string using the `join()` method with a space as the separator and returns the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author's intention with this `pig_latin` function is to convert a given text into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a language game that alters English words by moving the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word, followed by the letters \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is added instead of moving the consonants. The function achieves this by splitting the input text into words, applying the `translate` function to each word, and then joining the translated words back into a single string.\u001b[0m\n",

Each test case is represented by a tuple with the `text` input and the `expected` output. The `test_pig_latin` function is defined to run each test case and assert that the output of `pig_latin(text)` matches the expected result."
